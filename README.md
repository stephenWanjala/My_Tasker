# My Tasker
Built using Jetpack libraries, including Jetpack Compose for the user interface, Room for data storage, and Dagger Hilt for dependency injection

### Features
`Add Task`: Users can effortlessly create new tasks with details such as title, description, start time, end time, and completion status. The app generates unique task IDs automatically.

`Display Tasks`: All tasks are displayed in a well-structured list view created with Jetpack Compose, ensuring users can easily access and manage their tasks.

`Edit Task`: Modify existing tasks as needed, including updates to the title, description, start time, end time, and completion status. Utilize Jetpack Compose UI components for a seamless editing experience.

`Delete Task`: Remove tasks from the list when they are no longer relevant. Users can opt to delete individual tasks or multiple tasks simultaneously.

`**Mark as Complete**`: Keep track of task progress by marking tasks as complete, providing a clear overview of accomplished tasks.

`Notification for Upcoming Tasks`: The application sends notifications for tasks that are nearing their end time but have not yet been marked as complete. This feature helps prevent important tasks from being overlooked.
